The title is a poetic translation of the Greek and Spanish names of the Death Star of Krakatoa.\n",
      "The film opens with the story of how an artist named Eiji Arakawa, in the early years of Japan, was entrusted with the task of creating a painting for the film “The Battle of Iwo Jima” which depicts the battle of Iwo Jima on 12 April 1942. Arakawa soon became known as “The First Japanese “The Destroyer” by his image. He was not only popular because of his talent and courage, but also because his painting “The Destroyer” had the following negative association with the Japanese.\n",
      "However, Arakawa's initial success with “The Destroyer” did not help his case. Eiji's family still believed that “War is the Enemy”, but in this context ”War is a war” meant to destroy Japanese culture. Arakawa had a small fortune, and a small business. His paintings would have many problems but the studio needed a large sum of money to make them work. This was not the case, but it was the end of Eiji's career.\n",
      "An adaptation of “The Battle of Iwo Jima” was released in the summer of 1944. It is based on the poem by Arakawa’s son Kōko. The film is set in the country city of Shizuoka. It tells the story of Eiji Arakawa (Arakawa Ichiya), who is the son of Japan’s general in Japan and the poet laureate of his country, and of his son Kōko. At 12 years old, Arakawa’s picture takes the viewer inside Japan’s most exclusive and dangerous frontier zone, which holds immense secrets and secrets that are almost as secret as our own.\n",
      "In the years leading up to war, Japan fought against the Axis to claim the entire southern half of the country of Okinawa (the Senkaku). In order to preserve and protect this strategically vital area, Japan had to defend the entire area. In the course of the war, Arakawa, Kōko and Kanaoka were forced to deal with an enormous obstacle, the Senkaku. It was all a matter of survival.\n",
      "Sometime later, Eiji's father was assassinated. Arakawa, who was now a poet, had died in the war to protect the Senkaku. During Japanese World War II, Arakawa, Kōko and Kanaoka took the job of guarding a secret base where thousands of thousands of Japanese soldiers had gathered to fight on the Senkaku. They were held to a high standard by the Japanese, and Eiji's father, after his death, decided that they would not do anything that would endanger Japan.\n",
      "The film moves away to explore the connection between Arakawa, Kōko and the legendary, secret base. This film is set on an island in the northernmost part of Okinawa, Japan. Sachi Ichiya, the son of Sachi Ichiya, is the only son of an idol who is living there with his widowed mother. He and his mother are members of a gang whose leader, Jōichi Ichiya, was a member of the gang before he died. Sachi Ichiya lives the life of a normal boy and his work as a translator with a beautiful blonde beauty, Keiko Fujino. When Keiko meets Arakawa through a newspaper photo, his mother asks him to share her work on a story about Japanese soldiers who are being taken prisoner in the Senkaku.\n",

The black cloud also appears from Tatsuka's body, which causes Noshio to become violent and become enraged and begin to scream. Noshio begins to turn against Tatsuka and begins shooting him, but he is saved by Noshio's mother, who tells the two samurai that they are no longer dangerous but just as dangerous as Noshio's parents. Tatsuka, and Noshio, are freed from their chains.\n",
      "After they are freed from their chains, Noshio and Ryutaro are in contact and begin to fight over whom to kill with each of their eyes until they have managed to kill one of their parents who had turned from a living being to a being to be found and murdered and eaten by a monster named Kyuranger. At this point, the three samurai are about to be slaughtered by Kyuranger, as he wants Tatsuka and their mother to return to the present to see what has happened and how they were killed before he was able to kill the other samurai. The next morning, the two warriors return to the present to see Tatsuka's mother, and they are reunited with the other samurai whom they were defeated by and Ryutaro, who had attempted to kill them and become his disciple, arrives the next morning. With the three samurai having now returned from their chains, Tatsuka is now free from his chains and he and Noshio, and Noshio himself, are about to be made enemies. They both escape the prison and get out at the next checkpoint but Noshio is still trapped in Noshio's body and she cannot move with her being alive, so he is also left behind.\n",
      "After the four friends and Kyuranger are freed from their chains, Ryutaro and Tatsuka visit Noshio and the other samurai to see that they are now united and willing to help the three samurai destroy her. Tatsuka tells Ryutaro that this is no good and he will never forgive her for it. In order to continue their fighting they will need their leader to act as their leader. Both of them agree and Ryutaro and Tatsuka move out of Noshio's room, and decide to continue their fight with Kyuranger. One of the three members that they defeated earlier, Tatsuka, Ryutaro and Tatsuka, is freed and tries to return to life and save Tatsuka, but is forced to flee when Tatsuka arrives and tries to commit suicide using a metal statue as bait, the other two that they defeated earlier, are thrown out of a tower of the same tower because they are captured by the monster. However, to reach Noshio's cell, they must now make amends and live their lives together.\n",
      "Finally, Tatsuka, Ryutaro and Tatsuka are freed and go back to the present where they have also learned that Tatsuka now has the skills required for becoming a human. They are then confronted by several men who are captured by the monster by the same monster that was holding them captive. As Tatsuka and Ryutaro arrive to the dungeon, they are captured by various men who come from both Noshio's cells for protection. Tatsuka tells them they need to kill the monster so they can save Ryutaro and Tatsuka respectively. Ryutaro and Ryutaro go inside Tatsuka's cell and Ryutaro tells Tatsuka that he will kill\n",
