### Using the GPT-2 model for movie synopsis generation -Description- \n\n
We have used movies synopsis from two large Kaggle movies datasets :\n
----- Wikipedia Movie Plots (~35,000 movies descriptions): https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots \n
----- The Movies Dataset (Metadata on over 45,000 movies): https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data,  \n
      where the cleaned dataset is on this link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZGp7ORu9nA6l3PyNK_H0MGTXNl4sNMsA \n
to fine-tune the two GPT2 models from OpenAI : the 355M model & the 124M model, by using the gpt-2-simple library (https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple).
